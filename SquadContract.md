Roles
=====

Squad Captain
-------------

- Balances development of squad with project needs
- Is responsible for co-ordinating squad members and projects
- Is responsible for detecting and expressing squad needs, current and upcoming
- Is responsible for reporting squad elasticity: ability to grow or accept change.
- Is responsible for co-ordinating with other squads to fill pressing technical gaps.

Strategist
----------

- Matches squads to projects
- Determines which squads grow
- Gets final call about ending a squad and folding its members into other squads
- Co-ordinates inter-squad relations
- Works with squad captains to plan squad splits
- must respect elasticity limits reported by squad captains
- if conditions require that elasticity limits be violated, they will coordinate with the Squad Captain to determine the best course of action


Squad Needs
===========

Here are the needs we expect a Squad Captain to take into account:
  - Ensuring that the Squad has a tech lead, and sufficient tech leadership for the projects at hand
  - Ensuring that the Squad is grooming a new tech lead for when the current one rotates out
  - Be aware of any Squad members quality of life issues
  - Being aware of any gaps in the squad's technical capabilities in relation to scheduled project work

Filling Technical Gaps
======================

  - allocating dedicated research time
  - Getting classes, sessions, or consultation from trusted experts
  - mob learning sessions with another squad
  - short-term exchange programs with other squads

Squad Elasticity Scale
----------------------

0 - No change is possible for the squad currently - the Squad needs time to gel

1 - The Squad can handle one new member *or* one member rotation.

2 - The Squad can handle one new pair *or* one member rotation.

3 - The Squad can handle *both* one new pair *and* one member rotation.

Where a Squad currently rates on the scale is to be estimated by the Squad Captain. This is an estimate of how much change the Squad can absorb over the course of a month.

### Baseline Expectations

In ideal conditions (squads performing full rotations, effectively co-learning), this is what we expect the elasticity of a squad to be given two months of no change:

|size in pairs | elasticity |
|--------------|------------|
| 2            | 2          |
| 3            | 3          |
| 4            | 3          |
| 5            | 3          |
| 6            | 3          |
| 7            | 3          |


If the squad had one rotation last month:

|size in pairs | elasticity |
|--------------|------------|
| 2            | 1          |
| 3            | 2          |
| 4            | 2          |
| 5            | 2          |
| 6            | 3          |
| 7            | 3          |

If the squad had growth of one pair last month:

|size in pairs | elasticity |
|--------------|------------|
| 2 -----------|------------|
| 3            | 1          |
| 4            | 1          |
| 5            | 1          |
| 6            | 2          |
| 7            | 2          |

If the squad had growth of one pair and a rotation last month:

|size in pairs | elasticity |
|--------------|------------|
| 2 -----------|------------|
| 3            | 0          |
| 4            | 0          |
| 5            | 1          |
| 6            | 2          |
| 7            | 2          |

If the squad had growth of one pair two months ago, and one pair last month:

|size in pairs | elasticity |
|--------------|------------|
| 2 -----------|------------|
| 3 -----------|------------|
| 4            | 0          |
| 5            | 0          |
| 6            | 1          |
| 7            | 1          |
