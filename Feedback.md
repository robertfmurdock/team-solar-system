- Bench thing is interesting and exciting
- Bench as distributed with skunkworks is important to the model (greases the system)
- Rollout; apply to one team first and see that the team can work *and be managed* in that fashion
- Discussed how that management change affects the high level management, removes names from the board
- Had a quick discussion about how clients will see it when a team works on multiple projects
- Rob shared the ShowPal example of a team that only worked on one project felt isolated from the rest of Pillar, and it
 damaged their ability to confidently deliver
- When a team works on multiple projects, even the smallest project gets access to the whole team's brain trust!
- Need to form up the sales pitch - how does this organizational model help us deliver more effectively to our clients?
