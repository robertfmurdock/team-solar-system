Why do you need squads that are stable and fluid?

Business Owner
--------------

I need stable, fluid squads so I can more effectively trust and manage the growth of my company. This kind of squad allows me to better understand which squads need attention and further development, and which are best able to grow.

Startup Client

Even though my project is small, working with a stable, fluid squad lets me take advantage of the knowledge and experience of the entire squad, even while my project only uses a few squad members at a time. When I visit the squad space, I can see ten people having a discussion about my project, when I'm only paying for two a day! These moments tell me that the squad is committed to making my project a success.

Enterprise Client
-----------------

Working with a stable, fluid squad really highlighted the difference between the squad and the staffing companies I use to power my other projects: they hit the ground running when they started, and quickly adapted their way of working to my environment. I can see how the squad's model for growth (cross-train, grow, split) mirrors what I need to do with my project team, and therefore I trust that my new hires will become more effective working with the squad.   

New Developer
-------------

I joined a stable, fluid squad shortly after joining the company, and within three hours of work, I was able to see code I wrote shared with everyone. The product owner even noticed the change! Joining an established squad meant everyone was prepared to show me how to participate, and they knew how to get value from me even though I know little about the domain or technology. After a month of working with the squad, people are coming to me for help. 

Seasoned Developer
------------------

I've had a lot of process fights over the years, and so I was relieved to work on a squad that had an established rhythm when I joined. It wasn't perfectly to my taste, but the squad listened to my feedback and we've been trying new things each month to help improve the process. I also greatly appreciate knowing ahead of time when squad members are going to be rotated to other squads, because it reminds us to always be trying to get new squad members ready to take over the roles of old ones. This system has removed a lot of ambiguity and stress from my life.
