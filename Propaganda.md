Why do you need squads that are stable and fluid?

Business Owner
--------------

I need stable, fluid squads so I can more effectively trust and manage the growth of my company. This kind of squad allows me to better understand which squads need attention and further development, and which are best able to grow.

Startup Client
--------------

Even though my project is small, working with a stable, fluid squad lets me take advantage of the knowledge and experience of the entire squad, even while my project only uses a few squad members at a time. When I visit the squad space, I can see ten people having a discussion about my project, when I'm only paying for two a day! These moments tell me that the squad is committed to making my project a success.

Enterprise Client
-----------------

Working with a stable, fluid squad really highlighted the difference between the squad and the staffing companies I use to power my other projects: they hit the ground running when they started, and quickly adapted their way of working to my environment. I can see how the squad's model for growth (cross-train, grow, split) mirrors what I need to do with my project team, and therefore I trust that my new hires will become more effective working with the squad.   

New Developer
-------------

I joined a stable, fluid squad shortly after joining the company, and within three hours of work, I was able to see code I wrote shared with everyone. The product owner even noticed the change! Joining an established squad meant everyone was prepared to show me how to participate, and they knew how to get value from me even though I know little about the domain or technology. After a month of working with the squad, people are coming to me for help. 

Seasoned Developer
------------------

I've had a lot of process fights over the years, and so I was relieved to work on a squad that had an established rhythm when I joined. It wasn't perfectly to my taste, but the squad listened to my feedback and we've been trying new things each month to help improve the process. I also greatly appreciate knowing ahead of time when squad members are going to be rotated to other squads, because it reminds us to groom new squad members to take over the roles of the departing. This system has removed a lot of ambiguity and stress from my life by making things more predictable.

Experience Architect
--------------------

Working with established squads has made dealing with the ambiguities of design work much easier - because they're not storming with each other, its been easier to settle on shared business language for the project. They've also become very practiced at repeating back to me what the design goals are... because they know they're going to have to share those goals with other developers. I know when I'm working with a squad, my work is better reflected in the final product.

Delivery Specialist
-------------------

Stable, fluid squads give me a lot of flexibility. Team member goes on vacation for a month? We've been cross-training... we'll be ok. Tech lead suddenly quits and joins a start-up? We've been grooming the next tech-lead for a while anyway. Because the squads help eliminate silos of knowledge, its smoothed the velocity of all the projects the squad is working on. And, working with the Squad Captain, I always know exactly how much capacity I'm going to get, week to week. When my product owner rattles me for extra capacity or velocity, the elasticity estimate tells me when the squad can grow, and the Squad Captain helps me distribute the squad in a way that can sooth the product owners concerns.
