  
The Big Idea
============

To create stable teams with predictable rotation of new team members in and out. 
  
  
By "stable", we mean teams that will
    
- Survive the end of a project
- Have a plurality of old team members when new team members are added
 
By "predictable", we mean rotation that

- Happens at a regular rate
- Is transparent and visible on a calendar
- Is trustworthy (not always invalidated by "special circumstances")


Why do we want teams that are stable?
-------------------------------------

Building team culture takes a lot of energy. Even when team members have similar values, forming a new team from members 
that do not have prior working relationships can be an expensive and stressful activity. When teams are formed 
specifically for projects, they may not last long enough to even exit this "storming" phase. 
  
Therefore, we want to create teams that can pay down most of that cost early in their lifespan, then bring projects to
 these teams; thus minimizing the friction of building a new team and letting the team itself develop its culture past 
 these initial "growing pains."
 
We think that this can create deeper team relationships, allow more opportunities for on-the-job mentoring, and let
  teams consider process experiments over a longer term.

Then... why do we want to rotate members through teams?
-------------------------------------

While having a stable team culture is very valuable, we want to avoid having a *stagnant* team. An important part of any 
culture is being able to teach and test its values on new members. While we want the rate of personnel change on a team 
to be limited, we want the team to be well-practiced at adoption.


What then must change?
----------------------


The first and biggest change is that the Team to Project relationship must be adjusted.

Before, a team was formed to execute a project and disbanded when the project finishes; the relationship was 1:1.
 
After the change, a team is formed and then granted one *or more* projects. As each project completes, a project of 
similar size or multiple projects of smaller size fill the vacancy.

To help illustrate this concept, let us think of projects as sized in this way:

 - A major project takes 5-8 devs, or 3-4 pair
 
 - A minor project takes 3-4 devs, or 2 pair
 
 - A micro project takes 1-2 devs, or 1 pair
 
 
Teams need the ability to grow and shrink in size in order to facilitate organizational change. That said, a normal sized 
team might be 4 pairs large. A team with four pairs can take on:

- One major project
- Two minor projects
- One minor project and a few micro projects

If a team has more than one project, then it is left to that team's discretion how to distribute work among the team's 
members... with the expectation that as time passes, all members of the team will gain experience on all projects.

Therefore, the team itself needs to be able to manage work assignment - clients cannot be promised specific individuals 
will work 100% of their time on the project. However, clients *can* be promised that the knowledge of specific team 
members is always available to the team, and the team can highlight processes that enforce this knowledge transfer 
(co-location, slack, shared-stand-ups, etc).

Another change that naturally follows, is that growth, in the sense of adding work capacity, should be spread 
among teams. Smaller teams should be prioritized to get them to a comfortable level, and large teams should grow 
to the point that they ought to split into two smaller teams. If the minimum team size is
two pair, and the absolute maximum is six pair, then teams should aim to grow to five to six pair before splitting, and 
the split should occur as 1-2 additional resources are added.

Process Modules
===============

There are a number of related processes that we believe will allow us to create teams with the desired properties. 

 - "Bring Work to the Team"
 - "A Team Can Have More Than One Project"
 - "Team Mitosis"
 - "Cohesive Teams"
 
The following sections will describe these processes in more detail. 
 
 
Bring Work To The Team
----------------------

This is the practice of establishing a team independent of a project. When a project ends, a new project will be 
needed to fill the void. Teams are not created in order to fulfill a project and do not disband when a project ends. The
principal benefit of this process is team stability.
  
A Team Can Have More Than One Project
-------------------------------------

As the title implies, this is the practice of allowing one team to work on more than one project. This has a number of
benefits, including:

 - Giving team members more opportunities to work on different kinds of projects
 - Smaller projects benefit from access to the experience of more team members
 - Teams adopt more responsibility for managing when each team member works on each project
 
Team Mitosis
------------

This is a process to enable team growth. Over time, a team adds members and projects until it hits a size where it can 
divide into two teams. Because project work will usually not become available at the same schedule as team members are 
added, a team will likely want a "skunkwork" project or two to work on while the team has more members then paying 
work. This may be thought of as a "distributed bench" - rather then having an idle team called the "bench", 
each team grows extra capacity.

Cohesive Teams
--------------

This is a guideline to help ensure that teams do not grow to unwieldy sizes, nor shrink to a point that makes them 
inflexible. In order to support the team properties we desire and the processes that support then, we recommend a 
minimum team size of two pair (four people), and a maximum team size of six pair (twelve people). Any smaller then four 
and swapping a team member with one from another team becomes a fairly radical change. Twelve people is likely the 
absolute maximum number of people a team architecture discussion can support. These limits are recommendations, and can 
be flexed according to needs in context.
